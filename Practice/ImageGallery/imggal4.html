        <p>A sunset is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. It is characterized by a gradual fading of daylight and the onset of twilight, which can be divided into three phases: civil twilight, nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight. The colors observed during a sunset are caused by the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, often resulting in vibrant hues of red, orange, pink, and purple. Sunsets are often appreciated for their beauty and are a popular subject in art and photography.</p>
