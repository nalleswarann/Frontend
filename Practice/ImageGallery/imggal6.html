            <p>A frame is a structural element that provides support and shape to an object or structure. In various contexts, frames can refer to different things, such as the framework of a building, the frame of a vehicle, or the frame of a piece of furniture. Frames are typically made from materials like wood, metal, or plastic, and they serve to hold other components in place, ensuring stability and durability. In addition to their functional role, frames can also have aesthetic value, contributing to the overall design and appearance of the object they support.</p>
