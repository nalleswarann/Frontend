        <p>The sea, also known as the ocean or the world ocean, is the interconnected system of Earth's oceanic waters, including the five major oceans (the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic) as well as the smaller seas that are connected to them. It covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface and contains about 97% of Earth's water. The sea plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate, supporting marine life, and providing resources for human activities such as fishing, transportation, and recreation.</p>
